##*Work For the Engine*
###CSV Reading
All **CSV Files** read within the engine read identically to one another however will require diffrent Readers depending on what is needed to be loaded.
To read a String (Text) into the engine the text must start with < and and with >
####Example
```<Text always goes betweem the brackets and, because of this, Commas can be used within the System.>```
