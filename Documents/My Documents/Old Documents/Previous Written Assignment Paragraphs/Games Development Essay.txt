Within the games industry, the release of a games console is an exciting time for developers, a new product offering something new to the market means an opportunity to develop and sell new games.  Both for the games developers who helped create the console, hoping to make a profit from the release and third party developers who can use the console to promote their newly released games onto the platform.  The failure of a console to sell will mean third party developers will not want to develop games for it, which in turn means consumers will buy other consoles.  This means that the inter relationship between the two is different from other industries in that the company releasing the new console, even though it has its own in-house games development team knows that it needs third party developers to develop other games as well so will encourage and incentivise them.  Both either succeeding or failing based on the others approach.
