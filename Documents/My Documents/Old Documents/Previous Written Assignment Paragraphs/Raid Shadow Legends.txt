Explanation and background of a successful game release

Given this it can be regarded as a very successful game commercially and as will be explained, caused a certain amount of controversy, although this appeared to add to its commercial success.

This report sets out the reasons for this:

1.	Market Research – new game concept?  
2.	A great game?
3.	The right platforms?
•	A successful marketing campaign

Successful marketing campaign
The main reason for Raid’s success was primarily due to its enormous marketing campaign to promote the game.  Plarium Global (PlariumGlobal) gave thousands of sponsorships to various influencers on Youtube (Youtube) asking them to promote the game with the promise of various in game rewards if they downloaded the game as soon as possible.  Due to the large influence of these influencer Raid gained lots of publicity across the site.   However, some of the followers started to resent the marketing approach, creating videos on the negative aspects of the game, making comments on the influencers videos criticising them for accepting the sponsor, or giving praise to influencers who don’t and making jokes about the sponsorships. Although this publicity was negative this affected the notoriety of the game adding to its already large success, unintentionally advertising the game, and giving it far more success.
What other marketing
Effect on the Games Industry
Although Raid was not the first game to use sponsorship to promote their game, its current success within this field has pushed other developers to push this method much further as opposed to other methods of advertisements such as trailers.
